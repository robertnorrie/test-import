+Drupal 7.41, 2015-10-21
+-----------------------
+- Fixed security issues (open redirect). See SA-CORE-2015-004.
+
+Drupal 7.40, 2015-10-14
+-----------------------
+- Made Drupal's code for parsing .info files run much faster and use much less
+  memory.
+- Prevented drupal_http_request() from returning an error when it receives a
+  201 through 206 HTTP status code.
+- Added support for autoloading traits via the registry on sites running PHP
+  5.4 or higher.
+- Allowed the user-picture.tpl.php theme template to have HTML classes besides
+  the default "user-picture" class printed in it (markup change).
+- Fixed the URL text filter to convert e-mail addresses with plus signs into
+  mailto: links.
+- Added alternate text to file icons displayed by the File module, to improve
+  accessibility (string change, and minor API addition to theme_file_icon()).
+- Changed one-time login link failure messages to be displayed as errors or
+  warnings as appropriate, rather than as regular status messages (minor UI
+  change and data structure change).
+- Changed the default settings.php configuration to exclude private files from
+  the "404_fast_paths" behavior.
+- Changed the page that displays filter tips for a particular text format, for
+  example filter/tips/full_html, to return "page not found" or "access denied"
+  if the format does not exist or the user does not have access to it. This
+  change adds a new menu item to the Filter module's hook_menu() entry (minor
+  data structure change).
+- Added a new hook, hook_block_cid_parts_alter(), to allow modules to alter the
+  cache keys used for caching a particular block.
+- Made drupal_set_message() display and return messages when "0" is passed in
+  as the message to set.
+- Fixed non-functional "Files displayed by default" setting on file fields.
+- The "worker callback" provided in hook_cron_queue_info() and the "finished"
+  callback specified during batch processing can now be any PHP callable
+  instead of just functions.
+- Prevented drupal_set_time_limit() from decreasing the time limit in the case
+  where the PHP maximum execution time is already unlimited.
+- Changed the default thousand marker for numeric fields from a space ("1 000")
+  to nothing ("1000") (minor UI change: https://www.drupal.org/node/1388376).
+- Prevented malformed theme .info files (without a "name" key) from causing
+  exceptions during menu rebuilds. If an .info file without a "name" key is
+  found in a module or theme directory, Drupal will now use the module or
+  theme's machine name as the display name instead.
+- Made the format column in the {date_format_locale} database table
+  case-sensitive, to match the equivalent column in the {date_formats} table.
+- Fixed a bug in the Statistics module that caused JavaScript files attached to
+  a node while it is being viewed to be omitted from the page.
+- Added an optional 'project:' prefix that can be added to dependencies in a
+  module's .info file to indicate which project the dependency resides in (API
+  addition: https://www.drupal.org/node/2299747).
+- Fixed various bugs that occurred after hooks were invoked early in the Drupal
+  bootstrap and that caused module_implements() and drupal_alter() to cache an
+  incomplete set of hook implementations for later use.
+- Set the X-Content-Type-Options header to "nosniff" when possible, to prevent
+  certain web browsers from picking an unsafe MIME type.
+- Prevented the database API from executing multiple queries at once on MySQL,
+  if the site's PHP version is new enough to do so. This is a secondary defense
+  against SQL injection (API change: https://www.drupal.org/node/2463973).
+- Fixed a bug in the Drupal 6 to Drupal 7 upgrade path which caused the upgrade
+  to fail when there were multiple file records pointing to the same file.
+- Numerous small bug fixes.
+- Numerous API documentation improvements.
+- Additional automated test coverage.
+
+Drupal 7.39, 2015-08-19
+-----------------------
+- Fixed security issues (multiple vulnerabilities). See SA-CORE-2015-003.
+
+Drupal 7.38, 2015-06-17
+-----------------------
+- Fixed security issues (multiple vulnerabilities). See SA-CORE-2015-002.
+
+Drupal 7.37, 2015-05-07
+-----------------------
+- Fixed a regression in Drupal 7.36 which caused certain kinds of content types
+  to become disabled if they were defined by a no-longer-enabled module.
+- Removed a confusing description regarding automatic time zone detection from
+  the user account form (minor UI and data structure change).
+- Allowed custom HTML tags with a dash in the name to pass through filter_xss()
+  when specified in the list of allowed tags.
+- Allowed hook_field_schema() implementations to specify indexes for fields
+  based on a fixed-length column prefix (rather than the entire column), as was
+  already allowed in hook_schema() implementations.
+- Fixed PDO exceptions on PostgreSQL when accessing invalid entity URLs.
+- Added a sites/all/libraries folder to the codebase, with instructions for
+  using it.
+- Added a description to the "Administer text formats and filters" permission
+  on the Permissions page (string change).
+- Numerous small bug fixes.
+- Numerous API documentation improvements.
+- Additional automated test coverage.
+
+Drupal 7.36, 2015-04-01
+-----------------------
+- Added a 'file_public_schema' variable which allows modules that define
+  publicly-accessible streams in hook_stream_wrappers() to bypass file download
+  access checks when processing managed file upload fields.
+- Fixed a bug that caused database query tags not to be added to search-related
+  database queries under many circumstances, and which prevented the
+  corresponding hook_query_TAG_alter() implementations from being called.
+- Fixed the "for" attribute on managed file upload field labels to improve
+  accessibility (minor markup change).
+- Added a 'javascript_always_use_jquery' variable which can be set to FALSE by
+  sites that may not need jQuery loaded on all pages, and a 'requires_jquery'
+  option to drupal_add_js() which modules can set to FALSE when adding
+  JavaScript files that have no dependency on jQuery (API addition:
+  https://www.drupal.org/node/2462717).
+- Fixed incorrect foreign keys in the User module's role_permission and
+  users_roles database tables.
+- Changed permission descriptions throughout Drupal core to consistently link
+  to relevant administrative pages, regardless of whether the user viewing the
+  Permissions page can view the page being linked to (minor UI change).
+- Fixed the drupal_add_region_content() function so that it actually adds
+  content to the page.
+- Added an 'image_suppress_itok_output' variable to allow sites already using
+  the existing 'image_allow_insecure_derivatives' variable to also prevent
+  security tokens from appearing in image derivative URLs.
+- Fixed double-escaping of theme names in the Block module administrative
+  interface (minor string change).
+- Added basic support for Xdebug when running automated tests.
+- Fixed a bug which caused previewing a node to remove elements from the node
+  being edited. With this fix, calling node_preview() will no longer modify the
+  passed-in node object (minor API change).
+- Added a user_has_role() function to check whether a user has a particular
+  role (API addition: https://www.drupal.org/node/2462411).
+- Fixed installation failures when an opcode cache is enabled.
+- Fixed a bug in the Drupal 6 to Drupal 7 upgrade path which caused private
+  files to be inaccessible.
+- Fixed a bug in the Drupal 6 to Drupal 7 upgrade path which caused user
+  pictures to be lost.
+- Fixed missing language code in hook_field_attach_view_alter() when it is
+  invoked from field_view_field().
+- Stopped sending ETag and Last-Modified headers for uncached page requests,
+  since they break caching for certain Varnish and Nginx configurations.
+- Changed the Simpletest module to allow PSR-4 test classes to be used in
+  Drupal 7.
+- Fixed a fatal error that occurred when using the Comment module's "Unpublish
+  comment containing keyword(s)" action.
+- Changed the "lang" attribute on language links to "xml:lang" so it validates
+  as XHTML (minor markup change).
+- Prevented the form API from allowing arrays to be submitted for various form
+  elements, such as textfields, textareas, and password fields (API change:
+  https://www.drupal.org/node/2462723).
+- Fixed a bug in the Contact module which caused the global user object to have
+  the incorrect name and e-mail address during the remainder of the page
+  request after the contact form is submitted.
+- Numerous small bug fixes.
+- Numerous API documentation improvements.
+- Additional automated test coverage.
